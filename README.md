# Getting Started

This project is written in Discord.js, you must make sure when you install that you are using the latest versio, or else the bot will error. I may not be fast to respond to issues if you create them, but I will try my best!

2. `npm i discord.js@latest` or any version lower. Any version above blocks your token.
3. Open the config.json file and edit the information accordingly.
4. In the main directory open the command prompt and to run the bot: `node index.js`.
5. The help command can be found under .help
